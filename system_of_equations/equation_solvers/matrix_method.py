class MatrixMethod:
    """
    A class for solving a system of linear equations using the matrix inversion method.

    Attributes:
    - coefficient_matrix: The coefficient matrix of the system of linear equations.
    - right_hand_side: The vector representing the right-hand side of the equations.

    Methods:
    - __init__(self, coefficient_matrix, right_hand_side): Initializes the solver with the coefficient matrix and right-hand side.
    - solve(self): Solves the system of linear equations using the matrix inversion method.

    Note:
    - The coefficient matrix must be square and non-singular for the matrix inversion method to work.
    - The method raises a ValueError if the coefficient matrix is singular.

        Initializes the MatrixLinearSystemSolver instance.

        Parameters:
        - coefficient_matrix: The coefficient matrix of the system of linear equations.
