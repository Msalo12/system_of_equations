class GaussianElimination:
    """
    A class for performing Gaussian elimination on a matrix to solve linear systems of equations.

    Methods:
    - __init__(self, matrix): Initializes the Gaussian solver with a matrix.
    - upper_triangle_form(self): Reduces the matrix to its upper triangular form.
    - solve_linear_system(self): Solves a system of linear equations represented by the augmented matrix.

    Attributes:
    - matrix: The matrix to be operated on.

    Note:
    - The matrix must be augmented with the right-hand side of the equations to use this solver.
    - The matrix is expected to have one unique solution, and the solver may raise ValueError for inconsistent or singular systems.
