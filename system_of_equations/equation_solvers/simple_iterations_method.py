class SimpleIterationMethod:
    """
    A class for solving a system of linear equations using the Simple Iteration Method.

    Methods:
    - __init__(self, matrix, initial_guess, tolerance, max_iterations): Initializes the solver with the necessary parameters.
    - solve(self): Solves the system of linear equations using the Simple Iteration Method.

    Attributes:
    - matrix: The coefficient matrix of the system of linear equations.
    - initial_guess: The initial guess for the solution.
    - tolerance: The tolerance value for convergence.
    - max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations allowed.

    Note:
    - The matrix must be diagonally dominant or strictly diagonally dominant for convergence.
    - The method may not converge for some systems, and it's important to set a reasonable tolerance and maximum iterations.
